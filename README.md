Very much a work in progress. Hopefully, it will eventually be "done"â€¦ish.

This is getting close to usable, but there are some pretty important pieces to sort out before it will be useful to anyone but me. [See the issue queue](https://github.com/brockboland/DayOneTagger/issues) for current tasks, and feel free to add more.

## Goal
My intent here is to make a utility app that will allow you to quickly flip through DayOne entries and quickly tag each one with a single keypress.

In my case, I've got some 2200 entries in DayOne, and they roughly fall into two different categories. I'd like to start using DayOne for more types of entries, though, so I'd like to get my existing journal in order. The idea is that I will see one entry and hit the 1 or 2 key to tag it as one of those two types, then hit the arrow key to move to the next entry. This should make for quick

## Warning
**This thing comes with no wraranty whatsoever. Use at your own risk. For serious. Back up your data.**

As of this writing, the path to my Desktop is hard coded and data isn't saved back to the original Journal directory, so you'd be hard-pressed to really break anything, but still: be careful.
